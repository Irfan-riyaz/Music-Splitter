## Files
- `app.py` â€” Gradio app entry (Space SDK: **Gradio**)
- `requirements.txt` â€” Python deps (includes torch, demucs)

- `README.md` â€” This file

## Notes
- Hardware: **CPU Basic** works but is slower; upgrade hardware for speed.
- Large files may take time; keep inputs short (â‰¤ 20â€“30s) on free CPU for responsiveness.
